## Full Description
FactfulNews is an app inspired partly by the book "Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World" and by everything we thought was wrong with the way we currently consume news and media.

Features:
- No distracting infinite feeds, 10 articles (per category) chosen everyday. Just like a newspaper!
- Simply, easy to use, minimalist interface.
- Browse what's most important in the world, not just what's personalized to you
- Customize the categories to what you're interested in, and max read time if you're in a rush
- Dark/light mode that obeys system settings
