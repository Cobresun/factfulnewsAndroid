## Full Description
FactfulNews is an app inspired partly by the book "Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World" and by everything we thought was wrong with the way we currently consume news and media.

Features:
- No distracting infinite feeds, 10 articles (per category) chosen everyday, just like a newspaper
- Simply, easy to use, minimalist interface
- Browse what's most important in the world, not just what's happening in your own country
- Customize the categories to what you're interested in, and max read time if you're in a rush
- Dark/light mode that obeys system settings

# Update (December 2022)
This app no longer works, for two reasons:
1. Google Play stopped accepting updates because they implemented some [stricter rules](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9935326?hl=en) around being an application that distributes news, and we were unable to comply with the restrictions due to the fact that we were not sourcing the news oursevles. 
2. [Heroku shut down its free tier](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter), which the [backend](https://github.com/Cobresun/Factfulnews-backend) for this app was hosted on, and given nobody was using this app (as far as I'm aware) - I decided to shut it down! Fun while it lasted though :)
